# EDA-Preprocessing
## Introduction
This repository contains code for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and preprocessing on a dataset. The project aims to uncover insights through data exploration and prepare the data for further analysis or modeling. Additionally, visualizations are created using Matplotlib to illustrate key findings.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
In this section, we perform various EDA techniques to understand the dataset better. This includes:
Summary statistics
Distribution of features
Correlation analysis
Handling missing values
### Key Findings
Summarize any interesting insights or patterns discovered during the EDA process.

### Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:
Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, etc.)
Feature encoding (if applicable)
Normalization or standardization of features

### Data Visualization
Visualizations are created using Matplotlib to help illustrate the findings from the EDA. Key visualizations include:
Histograms
Box plots
Scatter plots
Correlation heatmaps
